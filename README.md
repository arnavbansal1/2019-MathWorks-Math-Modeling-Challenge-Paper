# 2019 MathWorks Math Modeling Challenge Paper
Team of 5 worked to addressed the [complex challenge problems](https://m3challenge.siam.org/sites/default/files/uploads/M3%20Challenge%20PROBLEM_2019_FINAL.pdf).
Utilized machine learning and differential equations to develop computational models of the spread of substance use in American populations and their health effects.  Wrote 25-page [paper](https://github.com/arnavbansal1/2019-MathWorks-Math-Modeling-Challenge-Paper/blob/master/2019%20MathWorks%20Math%20Modeling%20Challenge%20Paper.pdf) to document models and findings.
